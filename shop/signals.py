"""Django signals for post-save/delete hooks on OrderItem and Product.

- Recalculate order totals whenever an OrderItem is saved or deleted.
  NOTE: bulk_create() does not emit post_save signals. In our create-order flow
  we compute the total explicitly, so that's OK.

- Remove image files after a Product is deleted. Missing files are ignored,
  real file/path issues are logged (but do not crash the signal).
